🌐 Chromium Browser Chromium is the browser where the test runs. It is the base browser for Google Chrome and works very fast with Playwright.
✅ Playwright Assertions Assertions are used to check whether something is correct. For example: Checking if a page heading is visible Verifying that a page opened successfully
